# Project of Computer Graphic 
I have developed this application as part of the Computer Graphics course for a project entitled « Toward a futuristic emerald Isle ». My idea was to create an isle in the sky, covered with emerald crystals on which a futuristic society has been developed.

See the document ./Code/Project_Computer_Graphic_report.pdf for more detail.
